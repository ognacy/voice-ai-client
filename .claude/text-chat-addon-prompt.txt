Now we will add a big new functionality - text chat, as an alternative to the voice chat. 

You will modify the UI, and add API interface to the chat version of the AI assistant. 

Server side:

The server serving the AI assistant offers a new set of endpoints for you:

API Endpoints (on port 8765)

  | Endpoint                 | Method | Purpose                                                 |
  |--------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
  | /chat/session            | POST   | Create session {caller_id} → {session_id}               |
  | /chat/message            | POST   | Send message {session_id, message} → {status: "queued"} |
  | /chat/session/{id}/reset | POST   | Clear conversation context                              |
  | /chat/session/{id}       | DELETE | Close session                                           |

  SSE Event

  event: bot_text_response
  data: {"response": "I will remember.", "to": "caller123", "session_id": "uuid"}

  Usage Example

  # Create session
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/chat/session \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"caller_id": "test-user"}'
  # Returns: {"session_id": "abc-123", "status": "created"}

  # Send message (response comes via SSE)
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/chat/message \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"session_id": "abc-123", "message": "Remember I put milk in the fridge"}'
  # Returns: {"status": "queued"}

  # Listen for responses
  curl -N http://localhost:8765/events
  # Receives: event: bot_text_response
  #           data: {"response": "I will remember.", "to": "test-user", "session_id": "abc-123"}

  The text chat shares the same LLM with registered HA and memory handlers, so all voice bot capabilities work via text too.

What needs to be implemented in this code base:

1. client that initiates a session, passes text messages and receives them back 
2. ui changes (explained below)
3. the client should open a session on sartup
4. if there was a previous session close it on startup (use LocalStorage to remember session ids ever created)

UI Changes:

Add a button, next to the existing one ("Connect"/"Disconnect") and label it "Reset text session" which closes
a previous text session (if exists) and starts a new one. 

Add another transcript window labelled "Text Transcript" below the existing transcript, taking some of the 
screen real eastate (shrink the events view by a half, and divide the remaining space between the existing voice 
transcript and the new text transcript window). 

Rename the existing Transcript view to "Voice transcript". 

The "Text Transcript" is to follow the exact same aesthetic, and implement the typical text chatbot interface,
with text from bot and agent and a text input field with a blinking commodore-style solid-rectangle cursor.  

Notice that input from the bot comes asynchronously, via the EventSource, and not immediately after POSTing
human input. It is possible that the bot will initiate some conversations. 

Let me know if anything is not clear.
