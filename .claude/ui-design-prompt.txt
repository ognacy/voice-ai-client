Use your frontende development skills. 

We will do a major remodelling of the UI. 

Change the aesthetics - we are going for a retro vibe, 80s style mainframe GUI. 

Green glow text. Make it look a bit like it is displayed on a CRT, but no flickering please. 

Changes to be made:
- remove the transport selector. make it default to SmallWebRTC
- remove the bot video panel. 
- simplify the conversation transcript window significantly. i want it to only display assistant/user text, like it would be displayed on a terminal window: 

bot: <something>
user: <something> 

- keep the events panel. remove the 'filter' option.
