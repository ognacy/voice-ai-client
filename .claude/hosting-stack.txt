So now I am starting to host this in my tailscale network. This is how it will be running in the mid term:

1/ dedicated homelab box running both the web app (this codebase) and the server (running pipecat and offering
voice via WebRTC, voice-related events via websocket, apis via REST on port 8765 and SSE EventSource 
via websockets, http://localhost:8765/events". 

2/ i created a service in tailscale, which is basically a reverse proxy: it maps 
app.brotula-velociraptor.ts.net to this machines's port 3000. it also terminates TLS, which means
the client browser (i am testing this on my iphone which is also part of my tailscale network)
sees this server as secure (https://app.brotula-velociraptor.ts.net) and serving on the standard
port 443 for https, not some non standard 3000. 

3/ the dev server is visible in the tailscale network as 
mbp16.brotula-velociraptor.ts.net

But this is just a routable DNS entry, it does not provide TLS terminating. 

3/ this works fine for 

  3.1/ the rest apis - i supose its because they are proxied by this web app, and not accessed directly
  through the pipecat server exposing http://localhost:8765. The calls to retrieve the list of memories
  or anything else via rest go through the https://app.brotula-.../ routes, and thus the browser does not
  complain about an insecure channel. 

  3.2/ the voice part. i have no clue why does it "just work". i don't understand how the client SDK for
  pipecat works - and how can it connect to a non-https endpoint that webrtc server expoes 
  (the POST/start/ on some high port number that seems to be the part of the webrtc session start). 
  If you understand how it works and why it just works with my tailscale setup - please create a
  Readme-Networking.MD file that explains it. 

  3.3/ the websocket connection to get pipecat events fails to get established, and i get a runtime 
  error in the client that says 

  'runtine NotAllowedError

  the call stack starts with setSinkID. 

  3.4/ the websocket connection to my own SSE EventSource also does not work. I figure it may have
  to do with the fact that it is defined in the config as ws://localhost:8765 which is not visible 
  from the iphone i am using for testing (which would be able to reach this ws server via 
  ws://mbp16.brotula-velociraptor.ts.net:8765, but i am not sure if the browser would like a
  seemingly unencrypted ws resource ("seemingly" - because in actual fact tailscale does 
  encrypt all the traffic, but it does not expose a neat wss:// endpoint automatically.

  From what I understand tailscale does not offer a wss:// service layer - they currently can wrap 
  regular http into https with their Services functionality. But the Wss I need to do myself, 
  and i suspect that I need to do the same for pipecat exposed wss too. 

Please let me know how can we fix it so everything works in a tailscale VPN environment.
